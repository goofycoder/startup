## thoughts

- profit center vs cost-center

- there's not much of a market for ideas. No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and use that to grow a user base. Then they'll pay big time.

- Determination is the single most important quality in a startup founder. Perseverance is important because in a startup nothing goes according to plan. Founders live day to day with a sense of uncertainty, isolation, and sometimes lack of progress. - People like the idea of innovation in the abstract, but when you present them with any specific innovation, they tend to reject it, because it doesn’t fit with what they already know.

- People think startups grow out of some brilliant initial idea like a plant from a seed. But almost all the founders I interviewed changed their idea as they developed it. PayPal started out writing encryption software, Excite started as a database search company, and Flickr grew out of an online game.

- Starting a startup is a process of trial and error. What guided the founders through this process was their empathy for the users. They never lost sight of making things that people would want.

- Successful startup founders typically get rich from the process, but the ones I interviewed weren’t in it just for the money. They had a lot of pride in craftsmanship. And they wanted to change the world. That’s why most have gone on to new projects that are just as ambitious. 

- Fast iteration is the key to success.

## quotes
- "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

-  "I'd say it's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower." - Paul Graham

- "Never underestimate the power of extra effort. It's not taught in school. It's not mentioned on resumes. But it's the one thing a candidate can offer to really **stand out**--and a powerful thing employers can look for to identify a great hire. **Make it your own little secret weapon.**"

- "The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit."
	- Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.

- “I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.” – Elon Musk

- Any product that needs a manual to work is broken. (Elon Musk)

- “If you don’t have peace, it isn’t because someone took it from you; you gave it away. You cannot always control what happens to you, but you can control what happens in you.” – John Maxwell

- “The only guarantee for failure is to stop trying” – John Maxwell

- The company that **consistently makes and implements decisions rapidly** gains a tremendous, often decisive, competitive advantage. (Steve Blank)

- **What matters is having forward momentum and a tight fact-based data/metrics feedback loop to help you quickly recognize and reverse any incorrect decisions. That’s why startups are agile.** By the time a big company gets the committee to organize the subcommittee to pick a meeting date, your startup could have made 20 decisions, reversed five of them and implemented the fifteen that worked. (Steve Blank)

- …some small segment of founders are truly artists—they see something no one else does. **These entrepreneurs are the ones who want to change ‘what is’ and turn it into ‘what can be.’** These founders create new ideas and new markets by pushing the boundaries. (Steve Blank)

- **Revolutions are not obvious when they happen. When James Watt started the industrial revolution with the steam engine in 1775 no one said, ‘Today, everything changes.’ When Karl Benz drove around Mannheim in 1885, no one said, ‘There will be 500 million of these driving around in a century.’** And certainly in 1958 when Noyce and Kilby invented the integrated circuit, the idea of a quintillion (10 to the 18th power) transistors being produced each year seemed ludicrous. (Steve Blank)

- In a startup, no business plan survives first contact with customers. (Steve Blank)

- We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about. (Einstein)

- We're even wrong about which mistakes we're making. (Carl Winfeld)

- Focusing is about saying no. (Steve Jobs)

- You want to be extra rigorous about making the best possible thing you can. Find everything that’s wrong with it and fix it. Seek negative feedback, particularly from friends. (Elon Musk)

- It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them. (Steve Jobs)

- That’s been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains. (Steve Jobs)

- You will badly regret the things you DIDN'T do far more than the things you did that were "wrong" -- the trip you didn't take; the project you kept putting off; the time you could have helped someone. If you get the chance - do it. You may never get the chance again.
